# Contributing

Thanks for helping with Folio! Bug reports, ideas, fixes and themes are all welcome.

## Before you start

- **Bugs:** use Settings › **Report a Bug** in Folio or the [bug form](https://github.com/McCal-Codes/folio/issues/new/choose).
  Include the Folio version, phone, Android version, folded or unfolded, and the steps.
- **Bigger changes:** open an issue first for new features or changes to dock geometry, fold layout or Google integration.
- **Security problems:** report privately, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Themes:** see [themes/README.md](themes/README.md).
- Everyone follows the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Making changes

Keep changes focused. In the PR, describe what's different for someone using Folio, and how you checked it.

Read the [code map](docs/architecture.md) for ownership, persistence and gesture constraints. The [user guide](docs/user-guide.md)
and [troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting.md) describe the behavior changes should preserve.

Folio builds with Java 17:

```bash
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug :app:assembleDebug
```

CI runs the same command on every pull request. Use disposable emulators for instrumentation tests. Fixtures that change
Home selection, profiles, widgets or settings must restore them; never use a personal phone as a fixture.

Preserve one-page-per-swipe behavior, native widget scrolling and long-press pickup, placements, widget bindings and
Home-page retention. Keep access optional and explain it where it's used. Layouts follow screen size, not device
checks. Tests should reproduce failures or protect meaningful behavior.

## What not to commit

Signing keys, passwords, SDK paths, personal layouts, account information, or copied application code. No GPL code and
nothing that needs root. Check screenshots for notifications, contacts and account names.

Contributions use the project's MIT license. Keep notices for third-party material and say where it came from.
