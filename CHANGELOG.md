# Changelog

All notable changes to Folio. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH; 0.x while
Folio is in development), and this file follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). The app's
`versionCode` is derived from the version name (MAJOR × 10000 + MINOR × 100 + PATCH), so every release sorts correctly.
Folio shows the newest section on the phone after an update, and every version under Settings › What's New › Version History.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added
- Alternate app icons: choose Olive or Soft in Settings › Wallpaper & Appearance › App Icon.
- Folio shows up as an app: its icon (in the App Library or another launcher) opens Settings, like iOS Settings.
- Clear Badge in an app's long-press menu hides its badge until a new notification arrives.
- Clock & Calendar setting: the apps' own icons, or live icons that are Automatic, Light or Dark.
- Coming Soon in Settings: what's planned next, with a Suggest a Feature link.
- Version History in What's New, with every earlier version.

### Changed
- New olive green app icon.
- Shorter, iPhone-style setup: Home app, notifications, pull-down gestures and a look. Optional permissions are asked where they're used.
- Settings has one list of permissions (Privacy & Permissions) instead of a separate Setup Checklist, and no repeated Home app rows.
- Live Clock and Calendar icons match the icons around them: light or dark to fit the app icons, the tint color for Tinted, and an icon pack's own Clock and Calendar when it has them.
- Layouts are checked against real Android phone, foldable, tablet and desktop screen sizes from Android Studio's device list.

### Fixed
- Back always closes Spotlight first, instead of sometimes changing the Home page behind it.
- Spotlight's keyboard comes back if it didn't appear when Spotlight opened.
- Spotlight's Cancel hides the keyboard and has a bigger touch target.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Focus: Do Not Disturb, Sleep, Personal and Work, with schedules, silencing, Home pages to show or open, Android 15 look changes, a Control Center module, and Focus actions.
- iOS-style app downloads: progress rings on updating icons, a Downloading row in the App Library, a blue dot on new apps, and an option to add new apps to Home.
- Add to Home Screen for widgets and shortcuts that apps offer, including websites from Chrome.
- Suggestions for this time of day in Spotlight, the Today View and a new Suggestions widget; Up Next widget, and Up Next on StandBy and the Lock Cover.
- Icon Stacks: swipe down on a Home icon to fan out the apps stacked behind it.
- Per-page icon size and labels.
- Themes: Classic, Dark, Tinted and Clear, plus saving and importing theme files.
- Half folded with the phone upright, Home rows that would sit in the fold move below it.
- What's New after an update.
- Report a Bug in Settings opens GitHub's bug form with your Folio version and phone filled in.
- Icon packs made for Lawnchair or Apex show up in Icon Pack, along with ADW and Nova packs.
- Share a theme file to Folio from Files or Chrome to apply it, and community themes in the repo's themes/ folder.
- Big screens: on tablets, Chromebooks and desktop windows Folio scales up like iPad instead of looking like a phone layout in a big window. Phones and foldables are unchanged.

### Changed
- Everything says Folio now: the README, user guide, troubleshooting, privacy notes, backup file name (folio-layout.json) and release files.
- Settings choices use iOS controls: a menu row with the current value that opens a checkmark menu, and segmented controls for two or three options.
- The Status Bar picks its text color from its frosted background, and uses stronger colors on light wallpapers.
- The side column is now called the Side Bar (status bar, Dynamic Island and dock), as on iPhone Duo.
- Edit while icons wiggle opens a short iOS 18-style menu under the button.
- Smart Rotate moves a stack to the widget that matters now.
- Settings previews draw Home with its real layout, widgets, status bar and dock.
- The status bar shows cellular bars, an airplane, or a searching fan when there's no Wi-Fi, instead of a line.

### Fixed
- Spotlight's and Settings' search fields no longer grow and jump when you start typing.
- Edit mode no longer pushes Home down or cuts off the bottom row: unfolded, + / Edit / Done sit beside the page dots and the Edit menu opens upward; folded, the bar clears the Dynamic Island.
- Apps and shortcuts added while a Focus hides pages go to a page that's showing.
- Selected rows in the Settings sidebar use a rounded, inset highlight; the widget resize hint is rounded.
- Long app menus no longer push Edit Home Screen and More out of view.
- Settings pages that could miss updates while a Focus hides Home pages.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Layouts that follow size classes: the unfolded screen in either rotation, the cover in portrait and landscape, and short windows.
- iPhone Duo-style Home: two columns on the cover in landscape, a centered page with a bottom dock bar in unfolded portrait.
- Settings split view with a sidebar on the unfolded screen; centered form sheets and iOS alerts.
- Hinge awareness: sheets, alerts and panels move off the fold when the phone is partly folded.
- Dynamic Island that wraps a side-edge camera, expands along the edge, and handles calls; live activities under the status bar as an option.
- Arrange Like iPhone; Lock Cover layout for wide windows; fold effect that follows the hinge and rotation.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Full-screen iOS-style Settings with search, Privacy & Permissions, Side Key and Lock Cover pages, and credits.
- Setup Assistant-style onboarding that walks through every permission Folio uses.
- Tweaks with per-screen overrides, Safe Mode after repeated crashes, local crash reports, and the Folio app icon.

### Changed
- Everything says Folio now: the README, user guide, troubleshooting, privacy notes, backup file name (folio-layout.json) and release files.
- Accessibility labels, text moved to string resources, and iOS styling across settings and pickers.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added
- Folio, forked from DuoLauncher by jakesgoodapps: Notification Center and Control Center panels, Spotlight, Dynamic Island, jiggle mode, quick replies, Smart Stacks, Today View, the iOS widget gallery, Quick Settings tiles, page scrubbing, automatic text color over the wallpaper, tinted glass, and tweak-inspired features.
