# Changelog

All notable changes to Folio. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH; 0.x while
Folio is in development), and this file follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). The app's
`versionCode` is derived from the version name (MAJOR × 10000 + MINOR × 100 + PATCH), so every release sorts correctly.
Folio shows the newest section on the phone after an update (Settings › Help › What's New).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Focus: Do Not Disturb, Sleep, Personal and Work, with schedules, silencing, Home pages to show or open, Android 15 look changes, a Control Center module, and Focus actions.
- iOS-style app downloads: progress rings on updating icons, a Downloading row in the App Library, a blue dot on new apps, and an option to add new apps to Home.
- Add to Home Screen for widgets and shortcuts that apps offer, including websites from Chrome.
- Suggestions for this time of day in Spotlight, the Today View and a new Suggestions widget; Up Next widget, and Up Next on StandBy and the Lock Cover.
- Icon Stacks: swipe down on a Home icon to fan out the apps stacked behind it.
- Per-page icon size and labels.
- Themes: Classic, Dark, Tinted and Clear, plus saving and importing theme files.
- Half folded with the phone upright, Home rows that would sit in the fold move below it.
- What's New after an update.

### Changed
- The side column is now called the Side Bar (status bar, Dynamic Island and dock), as on iPhone Duo.
- Edit while icons wiggle opens a short iOS 18-style menu under the button.
- Smart Rotate moves a stack to the widget that matters now.
- Settings previews draw Home with its real layout, widgets, status bar and dock.
- The status bar shows cellular bars, an airplane, or a searching fan when there's no Wi-Fi, instead of a line.

### Fixed
- Selected rows in the Settings sidebar use a rounded, inset highlight; the widget resize hint is rounded.
- Long app menus no longer push Edit Home Screen and More out of view.
- Settings pages that could miss updates while a Focus hides Home pages.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Layouts that follow size classes: the unfolded screen in either rotation, the cover in portrait and landscape, and short windows.
- iPhone Duo-style Home: two columns on the cover in landscape, a centered page with a bottom dock bar in unfolded portrait.
- Settings split view with a sidebar on the unfolded screen; centered form sheets and iOS alerts.
- Hinge awareness: sheets, alerts and panels move off the fold when the phone is partly folded.
- Dynamic Island that wraps a side-edge camera, expands along the edge, and handles calls; live activities under the status bar as an option.
- Arrange Like iPhone; Lock Cover layout for wide windows; fold effect that follows the hinge and rotation.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Full-screen iOS-style Settings with search, Privacy & Permissions, Side Key and Lock Cover pages, and credits.
- Setup Assistant-style onboarding that walks through every permission Folio uses.
- Tweaks with per-screen overrides, Safe Mode after repeated crashes, local crash reports, and the Folio app icon.

### Changed
- Accessibility labels, text moved to string resources, and iOS styling across settings and pickers.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added
- Folio, forked from DuoLauncher by jakesgoodapps: Notification Center and Control Center panels, Spotlight, Dynamic Island, jiggle mode, quick replies, Smart Stacks, Today View, the iOS widget gallery, Quick Settings tiles, page scrubbing, automatic text color over the wallpaper, tinted glass, and tweak-inspired features.
